# AVD PoC

I started a PoC in my own environment.

1. First try to set up an AVD environment, I tried the Getting started wizard in Azure portal.
* I had no AD DS, so the wizard provisioned AAD DS for me.
* I chose North Europe as the region.
* I put the same email in Azure admin and domain admin.
* I created two VMs with the Win 11 Enterprise multi-session + Microsoft 365 Apps, newest version.
* I also created a test user with a different email address that I own.
* Validation passed, so I hit Create.
